# Molecular dynamics
Simulation of the behaviour of a crystal lattice in different temperature conditions. Brief description following.

## Project steps
<ul>
<li>Definition of initial conditions
<li>Definition of finite difference method for time evolution of the system
<li>Definition of atom-atom interaction in the lattice
<li>Introduction of periodic boundary conditions
</ul>
